                <p>The Puddle Jumper HP is a souped up, slimmed down, re ned Puddle Jumper. It features a pulled in nose with the wide point brought back, and a narrower, pulled in tail block. The new outline enables the PJHP to surf even more like a normal board- a very playful board that’s easy to paddle and ride yet still allows more radical and quick turns than all the other PJ models. It’s easy on the eyes, sleek and re ned under the arm, and its smooth foiled lines deceptively hide its significant volume – with built-in speed to spare. Stand on the tail of this thing and simply go to town, up and down, round and round, like you have a motor in small surf. The tail, with its foiled rails and deep vee, holds in and gives confidence at high speeds. The overall at rocker, generous width, and deep central concave generate small wave squirt like you would expect from a Puddle jumper.</p>
                <p>The Puddle Jumper HP can take the domesticated gentleman into a realm thought long gone. Speed, with quickness, fast but loose, precise but playful. If you are one of the thousands of surfers who have enjoyed one of the Puddle Jumper series, the PJHP allows you to take your small wave surfing to the next level.</p>

                <p>Lib Tech are about to change everything you know about surfboards and everything you thought was possible in surfboard construction.</p>
                <p>Using 31 brand-new components to the surf industry and calling on 30 years of experience constructing environmentally friendly surfboards, skateboards and snowboards, it was inevitable that Lib Tech were going to produce some remarkable surfboards using this ground breaking, environmentally friendly manufacturing process. Each of the Lib tech surfboards is handcrafted in the USA with an unwavering focus on building THE toughest high performance surfboards in the world with a commitment to operating in an environmentally responsible manner.</p>
                <code>Nitrogen cell Foam/Hexzylon Fibre Skin/Woven Basalt Fibre/Bio-Matrix Resin</code>
                <p>The construction process uses a Nitrogen cell Foam (25-40% recycled content) core for maximum strength and pop. The foam is closed cell, completely waterproof and won't absorb water.
                    Hexzylon Fibre Foam Skin, this is a smooth, strong, impact and ding resistant layer with the signature Hex pattern.
                    Next comes the unique Woven Basalt Fibre which is additive free super strong and resists heel dents.
                    The Bio-Matrix Resin is super strong and environmentally friendly with the best flex qualities of traditional PU and a longer lifespan than Epoxy.</p>

                <p>Following on from the original FCS twin tab system and then the FCS Fusion system FCS 2 takes the world of surfboard fins to a whole new level of practicality and performance. The true innovation of the FCS II fin system is that it is the first keyless surfboard fin system on the market.</p>
